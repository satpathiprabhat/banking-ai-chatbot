# Reset/Change Debit & Credit Card PIN – NetBanking / Mobile App

> Purpose: Generic workflow for card PIN reset/change via digital channels. Never ask for or store card numbers, CVV, or OTP in chat.

## Supported Channels
- **Mobile Banking App** (recommended)
- **NetBanking (Web)**
- **ATM** (fallback method if digital channels are unavailable)
- **Contact Center** (IVR may initiate an OTP-based self-service; agent will not ask for your PIN)

## Prerequisites
- Card must be **active** and **linked** to your customer profile.
- **Mobile number** must be updated for OTP.
- Your digital banking access must be **active**.

## Steps – Mobile Banking App
1. **Sign in** to the app.
2. Go to **Cards** → select your **Debit/Credit Card**.
3. Tap **Manage Card** → **Set/Reset PIN** (naming may vary).
4. Authenticate using **OTP / biometrics** as prompted.
5. Enter **new PIN** (follow on-screen complexity rules), then **confirm**.
6. You’ll get a success confirmation. **Do not share your PIN** with anyone.

## Steps – NetBanking (Web)
1. **Login** to NetBanking.
2. Navigate to **Cards** → **Debit/Credit Cards** → **PIN Services**.
3. Choose **Set/Reset PIN** for the specific card.
4. Verify using **OTP / grid card / 2FA** (as applicable).
5. Enter and confirm the **new PIN**; submit to complete.

## Steps – ATM (Fallback)
1. Insert card at a **bank ATM**.
2. Choose **PIN Services** → **Create/Change PIN**.
3. Authenticate (e.g., OTP to registered mobile).
4. Enter **new PIN** and confirm.

## Common Issues & Fixes
- **OTP not received**: Check mobile network, DND settings; retry; verify registered mobile number.
- **Card not visible**: Ensure the card is **active** and **mapped** to your profile; re-login; contact support if it persists.
- **PIN blocked after wrong attempts**: Wait for the cooldown period; then reset via the steps above.
- **App shows “feature unavailable”**: Try again later (maintenance window) or use another channel (NetBanking/ATM).

## Security Reminders
- **Never** share full card number, CVV, or PIN over chat/phone/email.
- Bank staff will **never** ask for your PIN.
- Change your PIN periodically and avoid obvious patterns.
