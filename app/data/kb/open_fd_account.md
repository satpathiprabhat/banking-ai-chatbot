# Open a Fixed Deposit (FD) – NetBanking & Mobile App

> Purpose: High-level steps and requirements to open an FD account via digital channels. Avoid PII and never request sensitive data in chat.

## Eligibility & Prerequisites
- You must be a **KYC-compliant** existing customer with at least one operative account (e.g., Savings).
- Your **NetBanking / Mobile Banking** must be **active**.
- Ensure sufficient **available balance** if funding from an existing account.

## Steps – NetBanking (Web)
1. **Login** to NetBanking (do not share credentials in chat).
2. Navigate to **Deposits** → **Open Fixed Deposit**.
3. Choose:
   - **Funding account** (e.g., Savings)
   - **Deposit amount**
   - **Tenure** (days/months/years)
   - **Interest payout**: Cumulative (at maturity) or Non-cumulative (monthly/quarterly)
4. Review the **displayed interest rate** and **maturity value** (auto-calculated).
5. Read & accept **T&C** (premature withdrawal penalties may apply).
6. **Confirm**. You’ll receive an **FD advice/receipt** in the secure inbox or as a downloadable PDF.

## Steps – Mobile Banking (App)
1. Launch the app and **sign in**.
2. Tap **Deposits** → **Open FD**.
3. Select **funding account**, **amount**, **tenure**, and **payout option**.
4. Verify **rate** & **maturity details** on the confirmation screen.
5. Accept **T&C** and **confirm**. Save the **FD receipt**.

## Notes & Best Practices
- **Senior citizen** option must be selected if applicable to reflect the rate benefit.
- **Partial funding** or **multiple FDs**: If supported, you can split amount by creating multiple FDs.
- **Nomination**: Add/update nomination as per the on-screen flow.
- **Premature Closure**: Allowed as per policy; could attract penalty and differential rate.

## Troubleshooting
- **FD option not visible**: Check if your account is **dormant** or if **maintenance** is ongoing.
- **Rate not loading**: Refresh session; try another browser/device; verify network stability.
- **Payment failed**: Check available balance/limits; retry; contact support if debited without FD creation (the amount is typically auto-reversed per policy timelines).
