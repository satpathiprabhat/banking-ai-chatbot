# Fixed Deposit (FD) – Interest Rates (Policy Overview)

> Purpose: Provide **policy-style** guidance. Do **not** state live rates unless explicitly provided in official documents.

## Key Points
- **Rates are dynamic** and vary by **tenure**, **deposit amount**, **customer category** (e.g., senior citizen), and **channel** (branch vs online).
- Banks typically publish current FD rates on the **official website → Deposits → Fixed Deposits → Interest Rates** page.
- **Senior citizen** rates are usually **higher** (additional spread over card rates).
- **Special tenures** (e.g., 444/555 days) may carry promotional rates.

## Safe Guidance
- Always verify **latest rates** on the bank’s official site or authenticated internal content.
- If rates are not in the knowledge base, respond:  
  _“I don’t have the current FD rates in the bank’s knowledge base. Please check the official rates page or contact your branch.”_

## Typical Factors Affecting FD Rate
- Tenure: 7 days to 10 years
- Amount bucket: Retail vs. Bulk (≥ threshold as per bank policy)
- Customer category: Resident / NRE / NRO / Senior citizen
- Payout option: **Cumulative** (interest compounded & paid at maturity) vs **Non-cumulative** (monthly/quarterly payouts)

## Disclaimers
- Premature withdrawal may **reduce the effective return** and could attract a penalty as per policy.
- Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) may apply as per prevailing laws.
- Interest rates for **NRE/NRO** accounts may follow separate policy guidelines.

## Where to Check Official Rates
- Official website → **Deposits** → **Fixed Deposits** → **Interest Rates**
- NetBanking/Mobile Banking → **Open FD** flow (rate is shown before confirmation)
