Please check the official rates page or contact your branch.”_\n\n## Typical Factors Affecting FD Rate\n- Tenure: 7 days to 10 years\n- Amount bucket: Retail vs. Bulk (≥ threshold as per bank policy)\n- Customer category: Resident / NRE / NRO / Senior citizen\n- Payout option: **Cumulative** (interest compounded & paid at maturity) vs **Non-cumulative** (monthly/quarterly payouts)\n\n## Disclaimers\n- Premature withdrawal may **reduce the effective return** and could attract a penalty as per policy.\n- Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) may apply as per prevailing laws.\n- Interest rates for **NRE/NRO** accounts may follow separate policy guidelines.\n\n## Where to Check Official Rates\n- Official website → **Deposits** → **Fixed Deposits** → **Interest Rates**\n- NetBanking/Mobile Banking → **Open FD** flow (rate is shown before confirmation)\n- Branch notice board / rate circulars"}]
